# website-encontro-de-casais
 website created for registration of an event for couples;  
 
 Using Google Sheets as a back-end to store registration data;

 On this website, I used HTML and CSS to build and style the pages; and also JavaScript in some points, such as the navigation menu and an option to copy the pix key for payment
