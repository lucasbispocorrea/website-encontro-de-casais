# website-encontro-de-casais
 website created for registration of an event for couples;  
 
 Using Google Sheets as a back-end to store registration data;

 On this website, I used HTML and CSS to build and style the pages; and also JavaScript in some points, such as the navigation menu and an option to copy the pix key for payment

Initially, the site was developed with MOBILE use in mind.

Therefore, if you are viewing on a computer, use DevTools for a better experience

I'm studying to improve my responsive design.
